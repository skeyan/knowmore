                The legislation was created by Rep. Henry Hyde. “I would
                certainly like to prevent, if I could legally, anybody having an
                abortion: a rich woman, a middle class woman, or a poor woman,”
                he said. “Unfortunately, the only vehicle available is the
                [Medicaid] bill.”

                Because of centuries of systemic racism and bias, Medicaid
                disproportionately serves Black, Latino, and LGBTQ+ communities
                — people who already face other barriers to care and economic
                opportunity. Despite the federal law, 16 states currently
                include abortion in their Medicaid programs using state funds.
                (The remaining 34 states and the District of Columbia do not
                have abortion coverage in their Medicaid programs due to the
                Hyde Amendment).
